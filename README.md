        "¯\_(ツ)_/¯"   "Slught"\
        "(ಠ_ಠ)"   "Serious"\
        "(⚆_⚆)"   "Confused"\
        "ﾉ(•◡•)ﾉ"   "Happy"\
        "(ಠ︹ಠ)"   "Sad"\
        "Ⓣⓗⓐⓝⓚ Ⓨⓞⓤ"   "Thank you"\
        "(✖_✖)"   "RIP"

It requires:

Linux
Xdotools
x-server running

## Wayland

To make it usable with wayland I suppose that will be simply changing 'xdotools' with 'wtype' (https://github.com/atx/wtype) but... untested...

## Linux

Save the script (.sh file) and execute in console:

chmod +x <file>.sh

In order to do the script executable

Then add a hotkey to that script (execute command should be: ~/path_from_home/file.sh)

## MacOS

Buy a computer with better SO

continue with the Linux installation instructions

### Known errors

xdotool does not work when sharing screen
